# MBTI-Prediction model for Personality profiling
The Myer-Briggs Type Indicator is a comprehensive indicator of personality types and is used commonly in various settings, from Occupational choices to targetted marketing and personality classification. Given that the test takes approximately 20-30 minutes, this is overhead time that can be reduced and classification made more efficient. Hence, we developed a Prediction model for MBTI personality types based on **text input** by the user. We train our model on user comments extracted from Reddit.

## Models used
- Albert Tokenizer
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multi-Layer Perceptual (MLP)
## Findings and Analysis
We can talk about our accuracy here and do some analysis. throw in wordcloud of more frequent words for each MBTI
## Results and Conclusion
If we used multiple models or params or something we can recommend the most optimal one here.
